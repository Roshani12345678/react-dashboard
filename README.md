# 📊 My React Dashboard Web App

Hey there! 🙋‍♀️  
This is a simple (but kinda cool 😎) dashboard web app I made using **ReactJS**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

I built this project just to learn more about frontend development and how React works with components and styling and stuff. It’s not perfect (still learning!!), but I’m proud of it. 💪

- Reusable React components 🔁
- Tailwind CSS for quick and easy styling 🎨
- Custom widgets/cards (charts, stats, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **ReactJS** (my fav JS library so far)
- **HTML + CSS** (of course!)
- **JavaScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** (super helpful and fast for styling)
